0,Fabio Bigfoot,1 day ago,"Omg...so Bill is saying another ice age is better...ill take the heat!! Bill is spewing the same BS as all climate change a**holes are babbling on about!! Why dont we talk about what the governments are doing to hoax us into believing there is climate change. The chem trail spraying...this is not a conspiracy it has been documented and proven. Also HARP and the manipulation of the atmosphere. Anyone not familiar with what HARP can do and what it is...take a look.
And there are several of these installments around the globe, and it can do more than the official explanation. 
So until the governments start coming clean on their manipulation of the atmosphere...they have no right to tell me what to do in the meantime!! And for anyone who is buying this BS that the average person and cow farts are the reason for global warming...I dont blame you for believing that...but dont take the claims at face value. If you dig deep into those who are vocal on the subject you will find most all have something to gain by pushing this narrative.

Maybe I'm wrong idk, I do know that it's 100% wrong to have a carbon tax at the very least.

My goodness a first the dems were all about global cooling in tje 80s and now its global warming...... I MEAN PICK ONE ALREADY! Being a mechanical engineer dosent qualify him in all fields of science  it is not a science on its own.  Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering, physics, engineering mathematics, and materials science principles to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. ... It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery. I never even finished school and I know this.

Fox News don’t care about the truth. They just want their ratings up. Their viewers like drama and bullying of anyone of the democratic party. so that’s what they put out not necessarily false information but they leave out most of the entire truth. If that truth doesn’t boost ratings or add to their brain wash agendas. They are build a family of long time viewers by never changing who they are.,2
1,Reggie Anderson,2 weeks ago,Tucker does not know much. And very rude when speaking to guest. Tucker has no answers but calls everyone else liars because it’s not the information that he wants to hear. Tucker you are main stream media and one day you will look back and feel really bad about the person you are today.,0

1,Dan M,2 weeks ago,The only thing i dont get about republicans is y they dont believe in man made climate change. Cmon its really obvious .Is a volcano that releases Co2 into the environment any different than humans releasing CO2? If you dont believe just wait a few more years. ppl are populating exponentially  and polluting the environment exponentially. how can increasing populations and polluting not create climate change?,1
0,Hill C,2 weeks ago,"Everybody do not forget that back in 1976 the bill Moyer's journal show on PBS said that the Earth was going into an ice age.
Now all the sudden the so called partisan leftist hypocrite dishonest  climate model liars are saying that we are warming up. Nice try bill Nye ""the science guy"" ask any legit scientist and they will tell you that it takes thousands of years for this to happen not 40 years.
A volcano and many more eruptions on a regular basis would  definitely  affect the climate.",1

I am an average person and I know that the leftist climate models are a bunch of doctored up bull sh....tt
They base their climate model on the last 100 years or so.
They do not even bring up the scientific evidence that the Earth was warming some 2000 years ago and yes there weren't airports and paved parking lots 2000years ago.
This global warming scam is for profit and transfer of wealth .they want to financially punish hard working Americans in the form of bull sh....ttt energy taxes.
It's the leftist rich liberal globalist hypocrite thug elletest dishonest way to say is they want to control every part of our existence  and I guarantee you global warming and global cooling will not be affected by man kind .",0

1,Marvin Pineda,2 weeks ago,"Tucker is arguing the rate of what causes climate change. Scientist Bill Nye reinforces the argument with time, and reduces the conflict affected by minimizing the length of that time it takes. Tucker mentions people being the cause and to what degree. Here’s where the simple factor comes around. The uncontrollable variable is The Beach. The variable that’s causing this is gasoline. Why Scientist Bill Nye mentioned commerce from other countries was for the difference in product & business happening between The Beach and Streets. Yeah. It’s getting hot. But may be for Tucker where he is, it is. So why isn’t it taken care of? Perhaps inland it’s worse.",0

As for the French, until recently grape farming was restricted by their own government to just a few region. Since deregulation, they can grow grape anywhere. Parasites attacked farms long before industrial activity. Laki volcano in 1784, followed my many other massive volcanoes made the winters extra cold, killing crops, farm animals, and people. What normal climate is he talking about?",0
